# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".

# directly to the root of the documentation.
#
html_extra_path: typing.List[str] = []

# Text that is pre-pended to every built file. Useful for global substitution patterns.

.. |specializations_okay_different_types| replace:: User Specializations: ‚úîÔ∏è Okay! You can add other types to this classification by specializing the class template. Your specialization must have a type definition named ``type`` (as in, ``using type = ...;`` or `typedef ... type;``) inside of the class specialization that is ``public:`` accessible. Note that specializing any type not explicitly marked with this notice is |ub|.

.. |specializations_okay_true_false_type| replace:: User Specializations: ‚úîÔ∏è Okay! You can add other types to this classification by specializing the class template to a definition that derives from ``std::true_type``, or turn it off explicitly by having a definition that derives from ``std::false_type``. Note that specializing any type not explicitly marked with this notice is |ub|.

.. |reserved_name| replace:: ‚ö†Ô∏è Names with double underscores, and within the ``__detail`` and ``__impl`` namespaces are reserved for the implementation. Referencing this entity directly is bad, and the name/functionality can be changed at any point in the future. Relying on anything not guaranteed by the documentation is |ub|.

.. |unfinished_warning| replace:: üî® This isn't finished yet! Come check back by the next major or minor version update.

.. |generic_type| replace:: ``ztd_generic_type`` is a name used as a placeholder. When it appears as a name (or within a name) or a type, it can be substituted out for another type name!

.. |benchmark_warning| replace:: ü§î This is not an exhaustive benchmark suite, nor is it representative of all machines or architectures. All numbers should be taken in the context of the reported environment and standard library below, as well as any additional caveats listed.
